# RandomPokerDealing

## The goal of this project

 This website was made to learn ReactJS while applying various techniques that I learned from Clean Code book by Robert C. Martin. 
 
 ## Why random poker dealer?
 I came across a problem called Poker Hands on ProjectEuler.net. This problem is not about math but about system design and code structure. I saw this as a good opportunity to build a fun program and improve my Test-Driven Development skills.
