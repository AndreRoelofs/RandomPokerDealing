# RandomPokerDealing

## Why this project exists

 This website was made to learn ReactJS while applying various techniques that I learned from Clean Code book by Robert C. Martin. 
 
 ## Why random poker dealings?
 I came across a problem called Poker Hands on ProjectEuler.net. This problem is not about math but about system design and code structure. This is why python, a language that I used to solve all the other problems on the aforementioned website was not really fit for this task. It is of course doable but making it in ReactJS is a good opportunity for me to learn more.
